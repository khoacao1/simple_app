# Simple Integration Application - Demo
This simple app allows users to search for healthcare providers by entering their first name, last name, city, and state. The app sends a request to the *"https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/"* API and returns the relevant information about the healthcare provider.

To use the app, simply enter the requested information in the provided input fields and click the "Search" button. The app will display the search results in a table format. If the search yields no results, the app will display a message indicating that no results were found.

This app is built using the Flask framework in Python and utilizes HTML, CSS for the front-end. It is a great example of how to use APIs in Python and how to display the results in a user-friendly manner.
